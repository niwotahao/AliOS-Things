## Overview
* Keyword spotting example based on source code ML-KWS-for-MCU
  https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU

* this example support 10 words spotting: "yes", "no", "up", "down", "left", "right", "on", "off", "stop", "go".

* dnn_weights.c is generated from ML-KWS-for-MCU code weights.h.
    * You can train your own model, and use you own model data.
    * You can change it to a binary file, and put it in file system.

* wav_data.c is generated from wav file, audio sample is 16000, time length is 1 sencond. You can change the code ``` int16_t wav_data[] = YES_WAV_DATA; ``` to
``` int16_t wav_data[] = NO_WAV_DATA; ```, or to ``` int16_t wav_data[] = STOP_WAV_DATA; ``` to test other words. You also can generate this audio data from you own audio file.

* mfcc.c is generated from ML-KWS-for-MCU code mfcc.cpp

* DNN configuration is ```layer_info``` in uai_kws_demo.c, you can change it by your own model.
